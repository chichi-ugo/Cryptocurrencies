# Cryptocurrencies
CryptoCurrency Data exploration using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Purpose
In this analysis, we aimed to analyze cryptocurrency data and use unsupervised machine learning models to uncover trends in the data that may influences investors.

We preprocessed the data using pandas in order to fit the models, then used clustering algorithms to group the data points and make visualizations.

## Results
After the data is preprocessed - transformed to drop null values, filtering for columns of most interest, numerically encoding the categorical data - the data was then scaled and
